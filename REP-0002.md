## Abstract

This REP outlines a requirement to implement the Profile contract, which aims to address the challenges associated with tracking and modifying the relevant addresses of a validator. Currently, these addresses are scattered across different contracts, making maintenance difficult and leading to potential inconsistencies. The existing codebase does not allow for changes in these addresses, necessitating the renunciation of validator status and reapplication, resulting in financial loss as the stake amount from delegators is not automatically transferred upon reapplication. The Profile contract aims to overcome these limitations by providing a centralized solution for managing and updating the relevant addresses, ensuring consistency and minimizing financial implications for validators.

## Rationale

The motivation for implementing the Profile contract arises from the following factors:

1. Financial Loss: Validators experience financial losses when they need to reapply for their role, as the stake amount from delegators is not automatically transferred. The Profile contract aims to minimize these losses by streamlining the process and ensuring smooth transitions.

2. Address Security: In the event of a leaked private key or the need for key rotation, validators must update their corresponding addresses promptly. The Profile contract provides a centralized solution for managing and updating addresses, enhancing security practices.

3. Proactive Defense: The Profile contract offers an alternative option alongside the emergency exit for validators facing attacks on their nodes. This additional measure enables validators to protect their operations and maintain network integrity.

By addressing these motivations, the Profile contract enhances financial security, improves key management practices, and strengthens the resilience of validators within the network.
