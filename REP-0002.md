# REP-0002: Transition Bridge into a standalone application

## Abstract

REP-0002 describes the process of transitioning the bridge into a standalone application on Ronin. This will allow the bridge to be operated by its own set of operators, instead of requiring validators to run it.

## Rationale

Presently, validators on Ronin are obligated to operate a bridge operator node, which leads to a close integration between the smart contract code of the bridge and the consensus code responsible for maintaining the validators and their delegators. This architectural approach introduces unnecessary complexities. Despite the significant efforts invested in securing the current design, the tight coupling of these components severely hampers the ability to implement enhancements or introduce new features. Therefore, in order to facilitate future improvements for Ronin, it is essential to propose a separation of the bridge from the consensus, effectively transforming it into a standalone application.

## Specification

- The bridge now has its own set of operators.
    - Validators are no longer required to run bridge operator nodes.
        - Nodes do not need to relay the set of bridge operators on the Ethereum chain every day.
        - As a consequence, unavailability bridge operator slash and relaying slash are removed.
    - Bridge operators can be added or removed through voting.
- Rewards.
    - Currently, the rewards for bridge operator is funded by Sky Mavis.
        - We allocated 1,000,000 RON for bridge operator reward in the first year.
        - The rewards are automatically given to the bridge operators at the end of each period.
            - In each period, each bridge operator will be given a reward that is proportional to the number of votes in the period.
    - In the future, will introduce other types of rewards with the goal that the operators are profitable without receiving the fund from Sky Mavis.
        - Fee for bridge transactions
        - Add other services such that random number generator, price oracle, â€¦ that can bring more profit to the operators.
- Unavailability bridge operator
    - Tier 1: If a bridge operator misses more than 10% votes in a day, the operator is penalized for 1 day, i.e., it doesn't earn the bridge reward on that day.
    - Tier 2: If a bridge operator misses more than 30% votes in a day, the operator is penalized for 5 days, i.e., it doesn't earn the bridge reward for the next 5 days.
    - If a penalized bridge is slashed, the penalty will be stacked.
        - For example, if an operator gets tier 2 slashed on day 1, it will be penalized until day 5. Then, if the operator gets tier 1 slashed on day 2, it will be penalized until day 6. Finally, if the operator gets tier 2 slashed on day 4, it will be penalized until day 11.
    - If an operator gets penalized for 30 days (e.g., at day 100, it is penalized until day 130), it will be removed from the operator se

## Security

By transitioning the bridge to a standalone application, the consensus code of Ronin is significantly simplified. This simplification can save time and effort for future updates on Ronin. Moreover, it effectively minimizes the potential for introducing unforeseen security vulnerabilities, reinforcing the overall robustness of the system.
