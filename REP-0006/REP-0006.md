REP-0006
Title: NFT bridge

Type: Bridge Track
Status: Draft

## Abstract

This proposal seeks to enhance the functionality of the current bridge by introducing the capability to transfer NFTs between Ronin and Ethereum.

## Rationale

NFTs are integral to the Web3 gaming experience. Several projects on Ronin (e.g., CyberKongz, Pixels) require a reliable NFT bridge to facilitate their operations. With the goal to become the blockchain for gaming, we believe that introducing an NFT bridge could be highly beneficial for Web3 game studios.


## Specification

In this update, we introduce a new feature that allow users to transfer NFTs, both ERC-721 and ERC-1155, between the Ronin and Ethereum networks. This new feature enables users to bridge multiple NFTs from the same collection simultaneously. The bridge transfer will be approved if at least 70% of the bridge operators give their approval.

## Security analysis

We can ensure a secure and reliable bridge transfer process as 70% approvals of bridge operators are required to execute a transfer.
